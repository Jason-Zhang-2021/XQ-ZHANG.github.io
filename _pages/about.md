I am a second year master student from [MAE](https://mae.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) (expected graduation in 2025). I study the mechanism of noise caused by polygonal cylinder flow in air with my advisors, [Yu Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuy&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) and [Lian Gan](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/lian-gan/#supervision-students)
